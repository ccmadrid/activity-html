    <p>My name is Carl Christian Madrid, but I prefer to be called <em>Christian</em>. I have a background in <em>Engineering Physics</em> from <em>Carleton University</em>.I always had a partiality to the arts, but until recently, I had been skeptical of its validity as a stable career. Learning more about the harmony between design and tech is one of the factors that hooked me on design.</p>
    <p>So far, my experience in the design school has been enjoyable and educating. It is a great asset to be able to use and learn professional techniques and software instead of teaching myself through trial, error, and <em>Google</em>.</p>
    <p>The nerdiest thing I do that pertains to art and design is being a part of the designer vinyl toy phenomenon —I am a <em>Kidrobot</em> fanboy—, and more recently with the purchase of a dslr, being a shutterbug. Both hobbies are expensive, and as a student throwing away 3 years of one of the most expensive Engineering programs that Carleton offers, I'm pushed to be successful in this new career so that I can continue my designer addictions.</p>
